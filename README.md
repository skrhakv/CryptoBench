# CryptoBench
This repository is the main repository for `CryptoBench`, a novel dataset.

## Overview
1. The source code for creating the dataset is further detailed in `src/README.md`.
2. For training the benchmark method, a framework from [this repository](https://github.com/skrhakv/apolo) was used.

## Tutorial
To simplify usage of the `CryptoBench` dataset, we provide a `tutorial/tutorial.ipynb` notebook, where you can find useful snippets for parsing and handling the dataset.
